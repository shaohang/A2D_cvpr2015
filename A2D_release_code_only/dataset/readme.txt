This folder should contain the dataset and the code of improved dense trajectory. 
There are two steps to generate features for A2D implementation:

(1) You can simply run the script "compute_DT_script.m" first. It will generate dense trajectory features in txt files.  
(Note: In the script "compute_DT_script.m", we run dense trajectory binary file in command line.)

(2) Then you can run the script "txt2mat.m" to convert the txt files into .mat files.
